1. You can choose any website (e.g. [Mercedes](https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/), [Nike](https://www.nike.com/), [Apple](https://www.apple.com/)â€¦) 
2. Spend some time thinking about wireframing: https://balsamiq.com/learn/articles/what-are-wireframes/ I honestly recommend you go with good old pen and paper or something super simple like Google Draw, Paint or Balsamiq. Figma is of course ok but I don't want you distracted trying to learn all things Figma! So please, keep it simple.
3. You have the entire day to recreate the homepage of the website you chose! Try to pick one where the layout is rather obvious so you can maybe tackle it with Flexbox
4. I want a repo PER team. That means that:
      a) One in the team has to create the repo and add the rest as collaborators
      b) I want at least 1 commit per team member ðŸ‘€ 
      c) The main branch in your local copies should only be updated via a pull, the main branch in your remote should only be updated via a merge from a pull request
      d) Enable Github Pages! 
5. We will all meet at 4pm in the main classroom link to present the 5 projects.
